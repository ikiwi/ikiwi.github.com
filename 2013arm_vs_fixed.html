When my friends were getting mortgage, we used to debate whether ARM or conventional fixed mortgage fits them better.  ARM used to be scary when interest rates are volatile, and thus very profitable for banks, which is why banks love to push them.  But ever since the interest rates got tied to unemployment (Bank of English started doing that this year as well), the interest rate has remained low.  Doing some math shows that it can save as much as the HOA fees in SF.  ARM doesn't seem like a bad option, and you do decide to go this route, you need to get it now.

ARM is going away next year, because now banks are required to hold 20% of their mortgage, causing the approval process to become more scrutinized.  In order to compete, most mortgages are backed with at least 20-25% downpayment, and all-cash deals are common (it gives you the flexibility to remove finance contigency, shorter closing time, and you can always refinance to get a mortgage at your spare time).

Offering interest rates of 3-4%, next year going forward bank will need to confirm that buyers can afford the ARM rate + whatever the rate will be afterwards (~5/6%).  Bank has always been known for maximizing its profit (i..e points are great for banks, and so was ARM).  The new policy left banks with no incentives to offer the discounted ARM but everything to push fixed conventional.

With choices diminishing, lending is not getting easier.  But as a successful hedgefund manager once said, there are always opportunities no matter how bad the situation is.
