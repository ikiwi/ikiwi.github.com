If you are planning whether to get ARM or conventional fixed mortgage, you need to decide now or forever hold your peace.  The reason is that ARM will go away next year.
<p></p>
Banks are now required to hold 20% of their mortgage, the process are more scrutinized, causing the mortgages much harder to approve.  But if you do have enough cash, you can increase your chance of getting approved with more downpayment, or even better, an all-cash offer and then refinance later on.
<p></p>
Offering interest rates of 3-4%, next year going forward bank will need to confirm that buyers can afford the ARM rate + whatever the rate will be afterwards (~5/6%).  Bank has always been known for maximizing its profit (i..e points are great for banks, and so was ARM).  The new policy left banks with no incentives to offer the discounted ARM but everything to push fixed conventional.

With choices diminishing, lending is not getting easier.  But as a successful hedgefund manager once said, there are always opportunities no matter how bad the situation is.
