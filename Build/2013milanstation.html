    Some patterns that I observed from living in NY and SF.
    <p></p>
    I like people watching, and one of the many things that I noticed after moving to SF is the lack of high-end shoes and purses.  Shoes are obvious: SF is hilly, unless you're willing to bring an extra pair of comfy shoes and put them in your purse, it's not practical to wear Jimmy Choo. But I only spot high-end purses in SOMA, whereas Louis Vuitton's speedy was an entry-level purse in NY.
    <p></p>
    The reason to that, I thought, is perhaps SF people find happiness in things other than fancy accessories, or maybe because most men don't care much about expensive handbags and there are alot of them here.
    <p></p>
    The desire for luxury purses is even more crazy in Hong Kong, where Milan Station would take your purse as a collateral for loans. And just like a bank, they make sure that they get a good deal (my $1k brand new Marc Jacobs handbag only sold for $300, so in order to qualify for a substantial loan, the handbag must be very valuable).
    <p></p>
    Looking at the housing market trend.  In NY, the most drastic increase in the housing market happens in Soho, the shopping heaven, with average sale price for a condominium above $3.5k per square feet and $2.5k per square feet for coop (similar to TIC in SF), a 30% jump from a year ago.  Compared to less than 10% in most parts of NYC.  But in SF, things are more distributed, with 20% climbs in most of the 10 districts, except SFHs in district 8 (Russian Hill/nob hill/north beach area) soared 67% (condo is still at 20% increase).
