    This year is coming to an end.  If you are looking for a new year resolution, may I suggest you to check your credit report?
<p></p>

    I have overlooked this crucial piece when I was young and busy doing other stuff than looking at numbers.  Before SF, I've lived in NY, NJ, MA, and accumulated many addresses and lost mails from moving. I also did not setup autopayment because I was foolish. As a result, I missed payments, but it was not alot of money so I was like whatever. If you're like me, it would come back to haunt you later on when you're getting a mortgage, doing refinance or anything to modify your loan.  You will be surprised at how difficult and pricey things would become.
<p></p>
    Most credit institutes keep record for at least 3 years. Data storage cost alot of money. I work in the industry, it's still going and growing because it's lucrative. If you use a cheap bank and it's been 3 years, chances are they don't have your negative information anymore, but the credit bureau doesn't actively go and remove it. You can dispute it and improve your credit like a piece of cake.
<p></p>

    While you're at it.  You can also do something to remove yourself from online advertisement. For example, Spokeo is one of the creepy sites that collect people's data and allow paid subscribers to access them.  They get their info from phone books, the old school way, real estate records, social networks, and marketing surveys. Just go to their optout form and <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/optout">opt yourself out of this creepville</a>.
<p></p>

    One of the things that marketing people usually look for is your phone number and email address.  Your address is not as important because it costs money for people to spam you.  It adds up when things start to scale up.  In a typical building in SOMA, there could be 200 units, and that's already $100 in postage.
