Christmas is my favorite season, and cranberry reminds me of christmas.  I noticed that in SF there are alot more people with food allergy than other places that I've lived in. Here's a gluten free dessert for the holidays.
<p></p>
<ul>In a double boiler, melt:
<li>250g unsalted butter</li>
<li>160g valrhona white chocolate</li>
</ul>
<ul>Once cooled, add in:
<li>150g egg yolk</li>
</ul>
<ul>Stir in the following dry ingredients:
<li>250g chopped cranberry</li>
<li>zest of 2 oranges</li>
</ul>
<ul>To turn these into a cake, whip meringue into stiff peak form:
<li>260g egg white</li>
<li>210g sugar</li>
</ul>
<ul>
Instruction:
<li>Fold the meringue into the mixture 1/3 at a time. Spread them on a sheet pan, and bake at 325F for 8 minutes.
</li>
<li>To assemble, shape the flourless cake into a triangle form, sprinkle with mini pineapple chunks, side with vanilla ice cream, and top with lime zest.</li>
</ul>
