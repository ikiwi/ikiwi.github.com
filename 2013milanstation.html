    Some patterns that I observed from living in NY and SF.
    <p></p>
    I like people watching, and one of the many things that I noticed after moving to SF is the lack of high-end shoes and purses.  Shoes are obvious: SF is hilly, unless you're willing to bring an extra pair of comfy shoes and put them in your purse, it's not practical to wear Jimmy Choo. But I only spot high-end purses in SOMA, whereas Louis Vuitton's speedy was an entry-level purse in NY.

    The reason to that, I thought, is perhaps SF people find happiness in things other than fancy accessories, or maybe because most men don't care much about expensive handbags and there are alot of them here.

    The desire for luxury purses is even more crazy in Hong Kong, where Milan Station would take your purse as a collateral for loans. And just like a bank, they make sure that they get a good deal (my $1k brand new Marc Jacobs handbag only sold for $300, so in order to qualify for a substantial loan, the handbag must be very valuable).
    <p></p>
    Looking at the housing market trend.  In NY, the most drastic increase in the housing market happens in Soho, the shopping heaven, with average sale price for a condominium above $3.5k per square feet and $2.5k per square feet for coop (similar to TIC in SF), a 30% jump from a year ago.  Compared to less than 10% in most parts of NYC.  But in SF, things are more distributed, with 20% climbs in most of the 10 districts, except SFHs in district 8 (Russian Hill/nob hill/north beach area) soared 67% (condo is still at 20% increase).
