I always laugh that this doubles as a bicep exercise.  You know when it's done when your arm feels like it's about to falling.

The definition of a curd is citrisy.  Lemon's acidicity helps solidify the mixture a little better than berries but it also requires more butter to mellow the flavor down.  For a little-healthier alternative, berry curd comes out surprisingly nice.
<p></p>
<ul>Ingredients:
<li>160g lemon juice</li>
<li>240g sugar</li>
<li>160g egg</li>
<li>450g melted butter</li>
</ul>
or for a slightly healthier berry alternative:
<ul>
<li>160g berry puree</li>
<li>240g sugar</li>
<li>160g egg</li>
<li>315g melted butter</li>
</ul>
<ul>
Instruction:
<li>Using a pan and a large metal bowl, fill the pan with water to steam the mixture.  When the water is boiling, put everything except butter into the bowl and start whisking vigorously.  Once it forms into creamy texture, remove from heat and mix in the butter.  Using a strainer, filter out the lumps from the curd.  Let it cool.

<li>Lemon curd goes well with tarts and cakes.</li>
<li>Berry curd pairs well with choclate ganache.</li>
</ul>
