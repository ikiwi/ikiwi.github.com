I thought of this whenever I walked by a gym. This recipe could probably double as an arm exercise, because you can tell that the curd is done when your arm feel like it's about to fall off.

Curd is a citrus dessert, and the base can be any kind of citrusy fruits such as lemon or berry.  The proportions need to adjust though, depending on the level of acidity.  Lemon has higher acidity, which helps solidify the mixture a little better than berries.  And to soften the flavor down, I use more butter with lemon base.  For a little-healthier alternative, berry curd comes out surprisingly nice.

<ul>Ingredients:
<li>160g lemon juice</li>
<li>240g sugar</li>
<li>160g egg</li>
<li>450g melted butter</li>
</ul>
or for a slightly healthier berry alternative:
<ul>
<li>160g berry puree</li>
<li>240g sugar</li>
<li>160g egg</li>
<li>315g melted butter</li>
</ul>
<ul>
Instruction:
<li>Using a pan and a large metal bowl, fill the pan with water to steam the mixture.  When the water is boiling, put everything except butter into the bowl and start whisking vigorously.  Once it forms into creamy texture, remove from heat and mix in the butter.  Using a strainer, filter out the lumps from the curd.  Let it cool.

<li>Lemon curd goes well with tarts and cakes.</li>
<li>Berry curd pairs well with choclate ganache.</li>
</ul>
