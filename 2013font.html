    How a postcard turned me from a design dinosaur to a baby unicorn.
    <p></p>
    Style:
    <p></p>
    Font:
    <p></p>
    Color: can't go wrong with blue. Blue/purple is trendy. Grey is a tone, so it goes well with any color.
    <p></p>
    Font: to add more variety to the print, it's nice to have two fonts that complement each other. Since Sotheby's font is a Gill Sans (Humanist Sans), I mixed in Epic (Humanist Serif).  The fonts are opposite, serif and sans, one with the tails and one without. Together they will create a contrast rather than a confusing mix that looks similar but not exactly the same. This way, it creates a different feel to it, just like a wine pairing :)

    headline text: 3x body copy size
    sub headline text: 1.5x body copy size
    footer: .75x body copy size
    font size: 16px - 24px
    line height 1.5x
    leading: 120-150% of body copy size
    characters per line: 50-70
    To make the postcard intriguing and demand reader attention, I used asymmetr7 with large image on the left and balance that with grid and density on the right.
