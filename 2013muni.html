    My first ios app is attributed to a boy.
    <p></p>
    It's a app that allows users to look up and save bus (muni) route in SF, get real time update for up to 5 consequetive muni, and set alarm so that they don't miss the time.  The alarm time also adjusts continuously as estimated arrival time changes.
    <p></p>
    The idea is to take away the fancy map/gps UI and stick to a simple alarm system. The interface design is inspired by iOS 7's alarm app so that it looks and feels like a native app.  Backend uses sqlite3 db since it's pretty straightforward. And because of the amount of data (there are more than 3k unique stops!), I threw in multi-threading support to make time updates seamless.

    Currently available in my github.
